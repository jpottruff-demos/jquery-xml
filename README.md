    - open a terminal, `cd` into either project directory, run the following command, and naviagte to http://localhost:8080
        ```sh
        $ npx http-server ./
        ```

    - running it in the *.htdocs* of a **XAMPP** install
    - **or** any of *[these suggestions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12905426/what-is-a-faster-alternative-to-pythons-http-server-or-simplehttpserver)*
