      <review>(7/10) What's not to like about alien leeches that attack the brain and turn people into zombies?</review>
      <review>(3/10) I remember sort of loving it when I was twelve, meaning only that twelve-year-olds are idiots.</review>
      <review>(N/A) This is a terrific B-movie, full of genre love and filled with tributes to Dekker's horror movie heroes...</review>

      <review>(7/10) A leisurely, shambling, deadpan movie about a man who finds trolls and kills them. That's enough.</review>
      <review>(N/A) The film is shot with handheld cameras in the standard mockumentary style, but the content is often hilarious, especially when the trolls show up.</review>
      <review>(7/10) TrollHunter is both creepy and funny, a clever combination for this sly monster movie.</review>
